This code will sum up the number 1 for each combination of $i_{1}$ to $i_{6}$ where

$1 \leq i_{1} \leq i_{2} \leq i_{3} \leq i_{4} \leq i{5} \leq i_{6} \leq 50.$ Please note that this code might take a long time to run due to the large number of iterations. If you need to optimize it, you might want to look into more efficient algorithms or data structures.
