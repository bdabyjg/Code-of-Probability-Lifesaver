his Python code does the same thing as the original Mathematica code. It simulates a number of rounds of dealing cards to four players and checks if at least one player has all cards of the same suit. The observed probability of this event is then printed. Please note that in this Python code, the cards are represented as numbers from 1 to 52, where cards from the same suit are represented by consecutive numbers. This makes it easy to check if a hand is of the same suit by integer division by 13. The function `onesuit` takes one argument, the number of rounds to simulate. You can change this number to perform more or fewer simulations.
