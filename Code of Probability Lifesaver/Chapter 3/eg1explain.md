Sure, I can help you translate this Mathematica code into Python. Here's the equivalent Python code:
``` python
import random

def nothin(numdo):
    count = 0
    deck = [i for i in range(1, 14) for _ in range(14)]
    for n in range(numdo):
        card = [0]*14
        hand = random.sample(deck, 5)
        for k in hand:
            card[k] = 1
        if sum(card[1:14]) == 5:
            count += 1
    print("Theory says probability 5 distinct number is ", 2112/41.65, "%.")
    print("Observed probability is ", 100*count/numdo, "%.")

# Call the function with a specific number
nothin(100000)
```
This Python code does the same thing as your Mathematica code. It creates a deck of cards, draws a hand of 5 cards, checks if all cards are distinct, and counts the number of times this happens. 
Then it prints the theoretical and observed probabilities. 
Please note that Python uses 0-based indexing, unlike Mathematica which uses 1-based indexing. Also, Python's random.sample function does the same thing as Mathematica's RandomSample. 
The "for _ in range(14)" part is used to repeat each number 14 times in the deck, similar to your inner For loop in Mathematica. 
Finally, the sum(card[1:14]) part sums up the elements of the card list from index 1 to 13, similar to your Sum function in Mathematica. The print statements in Python are equivalent to the Print statements in Mathematica.
