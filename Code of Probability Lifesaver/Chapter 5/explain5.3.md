This Python code does the same thing as your Mathematica code. It calculates the theoretical and observed probabilities of a derangement (a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position). The function `derangement(n, numdo)` takes two arguments: `n` is the number of elements in the set, and `numdo` is the number of times to perform the experiment. The function prints the theoretical probability, the limit (which is 1/e), and the observed probability based on the experiments. Please note that Python uses 0-based indexing, unlike Mathematica which uses 1-based indexing. This is taken into account in the Python code. Also, Python uses `random.sample` for random sampling without replacement, which is equivalent to Mathematicaâ€™s `RandomSample`. The `math.factorial` function is used to calculate the factorial of a number. The `break` statement is used to exit the loop, which is equivalent to setting `i = n + 1` in your Mathematica code. The `print` function is used to print the results, which is equivalent to `Print` in Mathematica. The results are expressed as percentages, as in your Mathematica code. The function is then called with appropriate parameters to perform the experiment.
